You are given a 0-indexed integer matrix grid and an integer k.

Return the number of submatrices that contain the top-left element of the grid, and have a sum less than or equal to k.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[7,6,3],[6,6,1]], k = 18
Output: 4
Explanation: There are only 4 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 18.
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[7,2,9],[1,5,0],[2,6,6]], k = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: There are only 6 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 20.
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length 
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 1000 
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000
1 <= k <= 109 */

// Solution

class Solution {
    public int countSubmatrices(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int row = grid.length;
        int col = grid[0].length;
        int res = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                if (i > 0)
                    grid[i][j] += grid[i - 1][j];
                if (j > 0)
                    grid[i][j] += grid[i][j - 1];
                if (i > 0 && j > 0)
                    grid[i][j] -= grid[i - 1][j - 1];

                if (grid[i][j] <= k)
                    res++;
                else
                    break;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
