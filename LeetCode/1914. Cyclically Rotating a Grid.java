Hint
You are given an m x n integer matrix grid​​​, where m and n are both even integers, and an integer k.

The matrix is composed of several layers, which is shown in the below image, where each color is its own layer:



A cyclic rotation of the matrix is done by cyclically rotating each layer in the matrix. To cyclically rotate a layer once, each element in the layer will take the place of the adjacent element in the counter-clockwise direction. An example rotation is shown below:


Return the matrix after applying k cyclic rotations to it.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[40,10],[30,20]], k = 1
Output: [[10,20],[40,30]]
Explanation: The figures above represent the grid at every state.
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]], k = 2
Output: [[3,4,8,12],[2,11,10,16],[1,7,6,15],[5,9,13,14]]
Explanation: The figures above represent the grid at every state.
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
2 <= m, n <= 50
Both m and n are even integers.
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 5000
1 <= k <= 109 */

// Solution

class Solution {
    public int[][] rotateGrid(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        int layers = Math.min(m, n) / 2;

        for (int l = 0; l < layers; l++) {
            List<Integer> vals = new ArrayList<>();
            int top = l, left = l;
            int bottom = m - l - 1, right = n - l - 1;

            // top row
            for (int j = left; j < right; j++)
                vals.add(grid[top][j]);
            // right col
            for (int i = top; i < bottom; i++)
                vals.add(grid[i][right]);
            // bottom row
            for (int j = right; j > left; j--)
                vals.add(grid[bottom][j]);
            // left col
            for (int i = bottom; i > top; i--)
                vals.add(grid[i][left]);

            int len = vals.size();
            int shift = k % len;
            Collections.rotate(vals, -shift);

            int idx = 0;
            // put back
            for (int j = left; j < right; j++)
                grid[top][j] = vals.get(idx++);
            for (int i = top; i < bottom; i++)
                grid[i][right] = vals.get(idx++);
            for (int j = right; j > left; j--)
                grid[bottom][j] = vals.get(idx++);
            for (int i = bottom; i > top; i--)
                grid[i][left] = vals.get(idx++);
        }
        return grid;
    }
